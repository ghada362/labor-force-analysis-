# Egypt Labor Market Insights

An end-to-end data platform analyzing Egypt's labor market, built on CAPMAS 2024 national labor force survey data. The project covers the complete BI lifecycle — from raw survey data to interactive dashboards, automated reporting, and an AI-powered assistant.

## 📊 Project Overview

The Egyptian Labour Force survey (CAPMAS 2024) generated approximately **297,000 individual records** across 12 normalized OLTP tables. These records were scaled using the **Annual Weight** field to represent Egypt's full population of **106 million**.

The original OLTP structure was optimized for data entry, not analytics — leading to key pain-points:
- Complex multi-table joins required for every report
- Poor BI query performance
- No historical tracking or aggregation layer
- Difficult Power BI integration

This project solves that by building a complete **Data Warehouse (OLAP)** that transforms and consolidates the data into a reporting-optimized model.

### Data Foundation
- **Source:** CAPMAS 2024 national labor force survey
- **Scale:** ~297,000 individual records → scaled to 106M population via Annual Weight
- **Cleaning:** Python (pandas) & Excel — missing value imputation, outlier detection, type fixing, module merging
- **Modeling:** ERD design + relational modeling in SQL Server using Red Gate tools

### Data Warehouse
Built in three stages:

**Stage 1** — Staging Area + Full Load


OLTP Source → Staging Area → Transform & Clean → DWH Target
Data isolation (DWH never reads directly from OLTP), transformation, and error handling before loading
One-time full load: 296K records across 12 source tables


**Stage 2** — Audit Columns + Incremental Load


Audit columns (CreatedDate, ModifiedDate, Last_Load_Date) added to every staging table
Incremental load fetches only new rows (WHERE CreatedDate > Last_Load_Date) instead of reloading everything
7 stored procedures: incremental staging (SP 1–4), Dim_Location load via NOT EXISTS (SP 5), MERGE on the fact table (SP 6), and ETL control updates (SP 7)


**Stage 3**— Automation via SQL Server Agent


The full 4-step pipeline (incremental staging → dimension load → fact MERGE → control update) runs automatically on a schedule
Results: 0 duplicate records, 100% upsert accuracy, fully automated pipeline

### ETL Strategy
- **Incremental Load:** `CreatedDate` audit columns + `ETL_Control` table to track load batches
- **Loading Methods:**
  - Dimensions: `NOT EXISTS` logic to prevent duplicates
  - Fact table: `MERGE` (upsert) strategy
  - Designed with SCD Type 1 & 2 readiness
- **Data Quality — 3-Layer Defense:** incremental filtering, MERGE logic, and unique indexes to guarantee data integrity
- **Automation:** SQL Server Agent jobs schedule and run the full ETL pipeline automatically

### Reporting & BI
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **SSRS** | Pixel-perfect paginated reports — labor force stats by governorate, salary distribution, COVID-19 impact, health insurance coverage, and more |
| **Power BI** | 16 interactive dashboards across 5 thematic groups (Employment & Labor Market, Income & Economic Profile, Education & Training, Demographics & Geography, Social Protection & Safety Net) — built with Arabic field support and weighted DAX measures |
| **Tableau** | Advanced analytical dashboards: Survey Coverage & Representativeness, Social Vulnerability Index, Income & Employment Statement |

### Smart Layer
- **RAG System:** built with **n8n** (workflow automation), **Docker** (containerized deployment), and **Visual Studio** (backend API & RAG logic) — enables natural language querying of the labor market data
- **Power Apps Form:** mobile-responsive data entry form connected to the SQL Server backend
- **Public Website:** exposes key labor market findings and links to BI dashboards and the RAG assistant
